# React Playground

## What is this?

Just a simple React site to show off some of the core React features.
Not meant to be anything fancy, just mostly for learning and to be used as a reference for things!

## How to run this?

Run the usual `npm install`, and then you can run `npm run dev` to start up the dev server (it'll tell you which port it is running on through local host once it starts up).

## How was this website made?

This website utilizes the React library alongside the build tool Vite.
I initially scaffolded it using the `create-vite` script, then installed/setup React Router, and then did my own thing from there.
